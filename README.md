# Analysis_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age

The code is an example of data analysis and visualization using the Python programming language and several libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset used in this code is related to provisional COVID-19 deaths by sex and age, and it contains information about the total number of deaths, COVID-19 deaths, pneumonia deaths, influenza deaths, and other related variables.

The code starts with importing the necessary libraries and the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Then, it performs some data cleaning tasks such as filling missing values with the mean or mode, replacing spaces with underscores in column names, and converting some columns to datetime datatype.

After that, the code creates several pivot tables to analyze the data by grouping it by different variables such as month, age group, and cause of death. Finally, it uses Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to visualize the data in the form of bar plots, which helps to visualize the trends and patterns in the data. The visualizations include COVID-19 deaths per month, influenza deaths per month, pneumonia deaths per month, total deaths by age group, and COVID-19 deaths by age group.

Overall, the code provides a good example of how to use Python libraries to clean, analyze, and visualize data, which is a crucial step in understanding the data and making informed decisions based on it.

Below are some of the data visualizations:
